# Telecom Churn Prediction - Advanced Regression Analysis

In the telecom industry, customers are able to choose from multiple service providers and actively switch from one operator to another. In this highly competitive market, the telecommunications industry experiences an average of 15-25% annual churn rate. Given the fact that it costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, customer retention has now become even more important than customer acquisition.

For many incumbent operators, retaining high profitable customers is the number one business goal. To reduce customer churn, telecom companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn. In this project, you will analyze customer-level data of a leading telecom firm, build predictive models to identify customers at high risk of churn.

In this competition, your goal is to build a machine learning model that is able to predict churning customers based on the features provided for their usage

## Problem statement
For telecom operators, retaining high profitable customers is the number one business goal. To reduce customer churn, telecom companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn.
- Analyze customer-level data of a leading telecom firm
- Build predictive models to identify customers at high risk of churn.
- Find significant features that are important in predicting churn. 

## Technologies Used
- Python 
- Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn
- Statsmodel, Scikit Learn, GridSearchCV
- Process: Exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, feature engineering, model building, hyperparameter tuning

## Conclusions

- Top 3 features that may help to predict churn are std outgoing calls, isd outgoing calls, and total recharge amount. 
- Internet usage doesn't seem to be highly relevant in predicting churn.
- The Random forest model is best model since it has higher recall score compared to other models.
